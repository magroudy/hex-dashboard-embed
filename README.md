# Hex Dashboard Embed

A simple HTML page that embeds a Hex dashboard with a dark theme. The page is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages or any web server.

## Features

- Dark theme with background color #1a2025
- Responsive design
- Embedded Hex dashboard
- Fallback error handling for iframe loading issues

## Usage

Simply open the `hex.html` file in a web browser. For best results, host it on a web server rather than opening it locally.

## Note

The dashboard must be hosted on a web server (not opened locally) to work properly due to iframe security restrictions.
